How it works?

1. When you meet a new word you send it with the context to the bot, \
using command "/addwords".

2. Everyday for a week the bot will send you a set of words which you have \
to read two times consciously. You have to understand the meaning of the \
phrase during reading, it's the most important point of the method. For \
example if you start the training in 1st day of month you should finish \
this step in 7st .
Each phrase reading takes aroung 10 seconds.

3. After a week of working the second step out you forget about the words \
which you trained, also for a week. So from 8th to 14th days you shouldn't \
remember about these words.

4. Then in 15th day you should read aloud each phrase you got. Very \
important to read the phrases aloud and understanding the meaning consciously.
Reading each phrase three times takes around 30 seconds.
Then you should forget about the phrases for two weeks.

5. In 29th day you should again complete the fourth step. It takes 30 \
seconds for each phrase.

In the end you spend 70 + 10 + 10 seconds for each learing phrase.
